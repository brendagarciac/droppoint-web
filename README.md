# DropPoint Website
Official website created for the completion of my capstone project: https://brendagarciac.github.io/droppoint-web/
The website enables users with an UI to download the DropPoint mobile application from their devices. 
The page only has one functionality, however, the user is also able to read the main functions of the app!
